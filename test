\subsection{Influence of Parameters}
In order to deeply understand the performance of CCR, we investigate the impacts of key parameter settings among CCR, including Top-$K$ and $\lambda$.
First and foremost, $\lambda$ is adopted in Eq~\eqref{deltaoptimization} and Eq~\eqref{generatedelta}, a large highlights explanation strength while decreasing the significance of complexity.
As illustrated on the left part of Figure~\ref{fig:rq4}, increasing $\lambda$ causes CCR to successfully generate explanations for more items, but it also increases explanation complexity as more attributes are required..
Furthermore, we observed that the explanation strength is very steady and is not strongly impacted by $\lambda$.
This is due to the fact that $\epsilon$ governs the margin for the ranking score to turn a recommendation.
The middle and right parts clearly show that the recommendation performance improves as $K$ increases.
For example, average turn decreases as $K$ increases, whereas SR@20 increases as $K$ increases.
This makes sense since the $K$ value represents the number of items recommended at any given time.
The more items that are recommended, the higher success rate is.
Therefore, we conclude that the optimal $\lambda$ is 6, and the value of $K$ can be adjusted to meet the needs.
